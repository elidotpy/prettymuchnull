# Pretty Much Null
## Null, from [the broken script](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/the-broken-script-official), but without any mods

This is a random project that I decided to make, after failing to befriend Null, and he crashing my pc, because i really want to befriend null.

What he can do, right now:

Respond to anything Null could, I'm pretty sure, but not exactly in the same way. I'm still learning JS and mineflayer, don't expect much from me.

The code is probably *broken* (get it? because The **Broken** Script??) in some versions of minecraft, so use 1.21.1. please :3

## Requirements

- NodeJS (I'm using v22.16.0, didn't test in any other version)
- A cracked server running on port 25565 or a LAN world with the port 25565
- You need to give OP to Null.

### Why cracked?
because Null doesn't use a real minecraft account.

### How to do that?
If you want to do it using LAN,
join a world, press ESC, click "Open to LAN", set "Allow Commands" to ON, and in the Port Number, write "25565", and then, "Start LAN World"

If you want to do it using a server,
I'm just going to assume you already set it up, and know how to access the console,
type "op Null"
done

### Why does Null need OP? Are you trying to KILL MY WORLD, ELIDOTPY?!?!
No, i'm not trying to "kill your world".
Null needs OP because some of the things he can do DEPENDS on him having OP.

a very good example is when you send "Null" to him.
it needs:
/effect
/kill
/gamerule

and all of those are only possible if you have OP.
You can check the code, if you still don't believe me :P

## How to run?

0 - make sure the server is running / the lan is created
1 - Clone the repository
2 - run `npm install` inside the folder created
2.1 - wait...
3 - run node app.js


## Null is a Steve. Help.
Null's skin depends on SkinRestorer. either download that mod, if you're using Fabric, or download the plugin into your server.
then restart Null.
and you should see his skin changing.

## What are those "Future thingies" in the code?
Future thingies. ignore. also, pretty much spoilers :P


### wait, does all the projects need licenses?
i guess i'll just use MIT
